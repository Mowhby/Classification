# Classification Project

## Key Concepts Learned:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  Understanding how to classify data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.

- **Bagging**  
  Exploring the ensemble method of combining multiple models to improve stability and accuracy.

- **AdaBoost**  
  Learning how adaptive boosting combines weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.

- **Random Forest**  
  Understanding how an ensemble of decision trees can reduce variance and improve prediction accuracy.
